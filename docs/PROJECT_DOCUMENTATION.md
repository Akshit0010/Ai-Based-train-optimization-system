2. **Network Congestion**: Increasing traffic density on limited infrastructure
3. **Complex Constraints**: Safety, track resources, signaling systems, platform availability
4. **Priority Management**: Balancing different train types and priorities
5. **Real-time Optimization**: Need for instant decision-making capabilities

### Solution Approach

The AI-Based Train Optimization System addresses these challenges through:
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- Real-time data processing
- Predictive analytics
- Automated decision support
- Comprehensive monitoring and reporting
